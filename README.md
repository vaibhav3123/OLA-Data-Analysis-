# ðŸš– Ola Ride Analysis using SQL & Power BI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
Ride-hailing services like Ola generate vast amounts of data daily. Analyzing this data helps uncover trends in customer behavior, ride patterns, cancellations, and payment preferences. This project utilizes **SQL** for data extraction and analysis, while **Power BI** is used for interactive data visualization. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.

### **Objectives:**  
- Analyze ride booking patterns and trends  
- Identify frequent cancellations and their reasons  
- Examine ride distances and vehicle type preferences  
- Evaluate payment trends across different user groups  
- Visualize insights using Power BI for better decision-making
